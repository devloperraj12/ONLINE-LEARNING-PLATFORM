This project, titled **CyberLearn**, is developed as part of **Task 2 of the CODTECH Internship**, where the goal was to create a basic online learning platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The platform is designed to provide a simple, responsive, and interactive user experience. It features a homepage, a sample quiz section, and a basic login functionality. The focus throughout the project is on keeping the interface student-friendly and visually appealing.

The main page (`index.html`) starts with a navigation bar that allows users to quickly access the home section, features, quiz section, and login page. The hero section welcomes users with a brief introduction to CyberLearn, highlighting its purpose — to provide a seamless learning experience with video lessons and quizzes. The features section presents four key offerings: Video Lessons, Interactive Quizzes, Live Doubt Support, and Certificates on Completion. These are displayed as clean, simple blocks with icons for visual clarity.

A major part of the site is the **quiz section**, which includes five sample multiple-choice questions on basic web development topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and hyperlinks. Each question has three options, and the quiz uses JavaScript to collect user responses. Although it doesn’t calculate scores yet, the structure is in place to build upon.

The **login page (`login.html`)** consists of two input fields — one for email and one for password — and a login button. A simple JavaScript function checks whether the fields are filled. If both fields are not empty, a "Login Successful!" message is shown and the user is redirected to the homepage. Otherwise, an error message prompts them to fill in their credentials.

The entire site is styled using a separate CSS file (`style.css`). It includes custom styles for layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness. It also features soft background gradients and visually appealing components like buttons and cards. The use of **GSAP animations** in the `script.js` file adds smooth entrance effects for headers, cards, and links, enhancing the user interface without making it overwhelming.

Overall, CyberLearn is a simple and clean web-based learning platform prototype. It demonstrates my understanding of front-end development and how to organize a basic interactive project with good UI/UX design in mind.
